                This project is funded by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI). In particular, it is  
                implemented in the framework of the H.F.R.I call "Basic research Financing (Horizontal support of all Sciences)" 
                under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan "Greece 2.0" funded by the European Union - NextGenerationEU 
                (H.F.R.I. Project Number: 15877).
            </p>
            <p>The duration of the project is 24 months (November 2023 - November 2025).</p>

                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>The goal of ALGOLINC is to study fundamental algorithmic problems that arise from the ongoing synergies between
                     machine learning and algorithmic game theory. The field of algorithmic game theory lies at the intersection of 
                     computer science, game theory and economics, and has evolved over the last two decades, out of the need for efficient 
                     algorithms in game-theoretic models. Our project intends to focus on two important—and to an extent complementary—research 
                     components. The first one  is centered around optimization problems that form the backbone of building efficient learning 
                     (training) algorithms with an emphasis on min-max optimization problems. The second one moves along a reverse direction 
                     and concerns contributions of machine learning to mechanism design. Mechanism design forms one of the main pillars of 
                     algorithmic game theory, and our goal is to employ learning-oriented approaches (such as the paradigm of learning-augmented 
                     mechanisms) in order to design improved mechanisms, with an emphasis on auctions for allocating resources but also on other
                     strategic settings.
